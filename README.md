# Music-Player
The Music Player Application is a Java-based desktop application designed to simulate the functionality of a music playlist manager. Leveraging a doubly linked list data structure, the application allows users to efficiently manage and interact with a playlist of songs. The graphical user interface (GUI) is implemented using the Swing framework, offering an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.


Key features include adding new songs with metadata (title, artist, and duration), removing songs, navigating through the playlist (next and previous), displaying the currently playing song, and rearranging songs within the playlist. The application ensures seamless playlist management while providing real-time updates to the "Now Playing" display. Advanced functionalities, such as the ability to move songs up or down in the playlist, enhance user control and flexibility.


This project showcases the integration of data structures with GUI development, demonstrating practical applications of Java programming in real-world scenarios. It aims to provide a user-friendly platform for managing music playlists while highlighting the importance of linked lists in dynamic data management. The application is a testament to effective software design principles and Java programming concepts
